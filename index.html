<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I am an <strong>iOS Developer with 3+ years experience</strong>, including exposure to web
development both in front-end and backend.</p>

<p>I enjoy developing complex applications, both in user interface and system
levels. I am currently working on QQMusic, the <strong>NO.1 music App</strong> in China. 
While developing for over <strong>100 millions</strong> users, I learn a
lot about code optimization, debugging and writing reusable code.</p>

<p>As an iOS develop lead, I develop Klook iOS App, which is featured as &quot;Best of 2015&quot; by Apple.</p>

<h2>Skills and Experience</h2>

<h3>iOS Development</h3>

<p><strong>iOS Software Architecture</strong> - I have good and board experience with iOS
software architecture. I <strong>refactor several core UI components</strong> of QQMusic using
MVC, making the code easy to understand and less error prone. In my
experience, MVC is not the only option for iOS Apps. During the development of
Klook iOS App, I apply MVVM to build the structure of the app. As a result,
the code base of Klook iOS App is simple to develop, iterate, test, and maintain.</p>

<p><strong>UI/Animation</strong> - I have rich experience in developing iOS user interface
and animation. It is crucial for an iOS App to excel in UI/UX. Therefore, I
work hard to achieve good UI/UX experience for every App I develop. I am
skilled in using storyboard, Auto Layout and CAAnimation. Because using Interface Builder is not friendly to version
control software, I prefer writing user interface code programmatically for complex UI components.</p>

<h3>Web development</h3>

<p>I am familiar with web development, both in <strong>front-end and backend</strong>. I have
develop and maintain several commercial websites using jQuery, CSS and
HTML. On the other hand, I have experience in Ruby on Rails development.
Therefore, I am familiar with network programming, for example, http, json,
tcp and Restful API.</p>
