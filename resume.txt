## Summary

I am an *iOS Developer with 3+ years experience*, including exposure to web
developemnt both in front-end and backend.

I enjoy developing complex application, both in user interface and system
levels. I am currently working on QQMusic, the *NO.1 music App* in China. In
the process of developing for over *100 millions* users, I learn a
lot about code optimization, debugging and writing reusable code.

As an iOS develop lead, I take major part in designing and developing Klook iOS App, which is featured as "Best of 2015" by Apple.

## Skills and Experience

### iOS Development

**iOS Software Architecture** - I have good and board experience with iOS
software architecture. I refactor several core UI components of QQMusic using
MVC, making the code easy to understand and less error prone. In my
experience, MVC is not the only option for iOS Apps. During the development of
Klook iOS App, I apply MVVM to build the structure of the app. As a result,
the code base of Klook iOS App is easier to develop, iterate, test, and maintain.

**UI / Animation** - I have rich experience in developing iOS user interface
and animation. It is crucial for an iOS App to excel in UI/UX. Therefore, I
work hard to achieve good UI/UX experience for every App I develop. I am skilled in using storyboard, Auto Layout. Because using Interface Builder is not friendly to version
control software, I sometimes prefer writing user interface code
programatically.

### Web development

I am familiar with web development, both in front-end and backend. I have
develop for and maintain several commercial websites using jQuery, CSS and
HTML. On the other hand, I have experience in Ruby on Rails development.
Therefore, I am familiar with network programming, for example, http, json,
tcp and Restful API.
